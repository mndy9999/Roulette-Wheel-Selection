# RouletteWheelSelection
This is a small C++ program that I wrote to check if sorting the individuals based on their fitness changes anything in the results of the Roulette Wheel Selection in a Genetic Algorithm.

After running it a couple of times, I have determined that sorting the individuals array doesn't affect the outcome, as the results are very similar.
